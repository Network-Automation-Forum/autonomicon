# autonomicon
We're building out a lexicon / glossary for "standard" and/or common network automation terms and concepts...

It's all markdown files in here.

## What's Here?
* We can dump bookmarks for everyone to share/study/etc in [Links.md](https://github.com/Network-Automation-Forum/autonomicon/blob/main/Links.md)
* 

## TBD...

More info as we get going, for now...

...Go nuts.
